This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

### All models are wrong, but some are useful.

```{r}
# Load the data:
# car braking distances in feet paired with speeds in km/h
# see ?cars for details
data(cars)
# fit a linear regression of distance on speed
m <- lm( dist ~ speed , data=cars )
# estimated coefficients from the model
coef(m)
# plot residuals against speed
plot( resid(m) ~ speed , data=cars )
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
